# Profit Blockchain - Client Remake

Profit (PROFIT) is a clone of Gold (GL) (a Silicoin (SIT) fork based on zcomputerwiz's build).

This is a remake of the Profit client, based on zcomputerwiz's Gold client. It's main purpose is to be a more easily auditable client, along with various functional improvements.

## Disclaimer

This is my first full attempt at doing a search-and-replace fork of a client, so there may have been a few things I forgot to replace or wrongly replaced. Luckily, this client was designed to be easy to audit. A VSCode comparison against zcomputerwiz's build of Gold is recommended (I might post a guide here in the future).

On the topic of auditability, I have decided to leave the source directory named `chia` for more a straightforward comparison. Hope you all understand.
